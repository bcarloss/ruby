# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# EXERCISE
# Play craps (roll two dice)
# When executed, this program should print out two random
# numbers, one on each line, simulating the roll of two
# dice. Set two variables, with names that make sense,
# then write them out to the screen. Show the total
# as well.

# HINTS
# Get a random number between 1 and 6 by doing:
# rand(1..6)
# Log output to the screen with puts:
# puts "Hello, world"

#Store a random number number in memory for the first die 
dice1 = rand(1..6)
# store a random number number in memory for the second die
dice2 = rand(1..6)

# store the total in memory 
total = dice1 + dice2
# write the first die to the screen in a user friendly way
puts "First Dice: #{dice1}"
# do the same thing w the second

puts dice2

# do the total
puts total
